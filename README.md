# Blog Post Application

## Description
The purpose was to create a blog post website where a user can enter in their information (username, tite of post and content of the post) which will be saved and displayed in the blog post page. They can nevigate back and forth to the main page to enter multiple posts, which will be displayed in succession. This application is desirable because it will store the user's input in local storage to make it persist for that browsing session. The site also offers the choice between dark and light mode styling with the click of an icon.

## Installation
N/A


## Usage
The functional website can be used to submit blog post information from a user. The information regarding username, title of post and the post content will all be saved to local storage and then can be accessed later on. That way, multiple posts can be stored at once. The user can navigate back from the blog post page to the original form page in order to enter a new post and that will then be added to the others. The user can toggle back and forth between dark and light modes using the icon at the top right corner, according to their preferences.
